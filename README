I have provided some instructions below to help with building and unit testing from source: 

1.  Building
Maven is currently the default building solution.

2.  Unit Testing
All unit testing is done via TestNG.  Staccato is built to work with both postgres and mysql so in order to run the unit test suite
successfully, you'll have to prepare both databases by executing the sql in the following files:

 - src/test/mysql-test-db.sql
 - src/test/postgres-test-db.sql
