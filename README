I have provided some instructions below to help with building and unit testing from source: 

1.  Building
Maven is currently the default building solution.  Once you have maven installed, you can type the following from the command line to build the project:

mvn compile

2.  Unit Testing
All unit testing is done via TestNG.  Staccato is built to work with both postgres and mysql so in order to run the unit test suite
successfully, you'll have to prepare both databases by executing the sql in the following files:

 - src/test/mysql-test-db.sql
 - src/test/postgres-test-db.sql

Once you have your databases setup successfully, run the following command to execute the unit test suite:

mvn test

3.  Installing a jar
To create a jar and install it to your local maven repository, execute the following:

mvn clean install
